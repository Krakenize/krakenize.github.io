In era of mobile applications, when startups spring up like mushrooms, we need tools which will ease the software development process.

Currently, the speed of software development matters a lot, and developers are looking for a way to speed up product maintenance. For this reason I decided to make a service that handles the most demanding tasks. Moreover, I designed this service to provide the best and most **reliable API** that shortens the time of development and makes the product more secure. Furthermore, it will make a solution available for users around the world at a fraction of a second. I also created **various libraries** to provide a smoother experience for developers in a time efficient manner. These libraries will help developers avoid working with servers directly.

In addition, service solves problems such as **user management**, **data storage** and **security**. I designed these additional features to speed up the software development process. Just imagine how much time developers spend on redundant tasks like image compression, data escaping and connection with social networks.

As a bonus, I have provided detailed documentation as well as specific code **examples** to help new users get started. The reason for that is, in my personal experience, tons of documentation explained everything in a complicated manner and were not user-friendly for new developers. Also, my solution includes some boilerplates that include everything you need to start coding right away.
Creating a functioning service that allows developers to concentrate their work more on interface design and usability rather than on routine and repeating assignments boosts up and eases the process of development. In my opinion, this service is what the market is waiting for.
